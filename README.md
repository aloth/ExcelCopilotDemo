## Introduction

In this tutorial, we explore insights from our donor dataset to understand donor behavior, campaign effectiveness, and seasonal trends using Excel Copilot.

## Copilot Prompts Script

### Visual Enhancement
To make our data more engaging, let’s add a colorful icon next to donors whose donation amount exceeds $100. This visual cue will help us quickly identify high-value donors.

**Excel Copilot Prompt:**
```plaintext
Add a colorful icon if Donation_Amount is more than 100.
```

### Days Since Last Donation
Next, we’ll calculate the number of days since each donor’s last donation. This will help us identify recent donors versus those who haven’t donated in a while.

**Excel Copilot Prompt:**
```plaintext
Calculate the number of days since each donor’s last donation and add this as a new column.
```
**Action Step:**
```plaintext
Insert Column
```

### Campaign Effectiveness
Let’s analyze how different communication methods, such as email and phone, impact donation amounts. We will identify which method is most effective for different donor segments.

**Excel Copilot Prompt:**
```plaintext
Analyze the effectiveness of different communication methods (email, phone) on donation amounts. Identify which method is most effective for different donor segments.
```

### Occupation Impact
Let’s examine the impact of donor occupations on their donation behavior. We’ll look at donation amounts and frequencies across various occupations to see which ones are associated with the highest donations.

**Excel Copilot Prompt:**
```plaintext
Examine how a donor’s occupation affects their donation behavior, including donation amount and frequency. Identify which occupations are associated with the highest donations.
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
Next, we will compute the lifetime value of each donor, which is the total amount donated over time. This will give us a sense of each donor’s value to our organization.

**Excel Copilot Prompt:**
```plaintext
Compute the lifetime value (total donations over time) for each donor and add it as a new column.
```
**Action Step:**
```plaintext
Insert Column
```

### Seasonal Donation Trends
We’ll identify seasonal trends in donations by calculating the total donations for each donor during different seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. These insights will help us tailor our campaigns to seasonal patterns.

**Excel Copilot Prompt:**
```plaintext
Identify seasonal trends by calculating the total donations for each donor during different seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) and add these as new columns.
```
**Action Step:**
```plaintext
Insert Columns
```

## Conclusion
By analyzing these aspects of our donor data, we gain valuable insights into donor behavior, campaign effectiveness, and seasonal trends. This information will empower us to make informed decisions and enhance our fundraising strategies.
